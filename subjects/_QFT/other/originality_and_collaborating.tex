\section*{Abstract}
These are never-ending notes where I teach myself stuff. 
Hopefully they will grow into something useful, possibly also for other people.
We should cite something \cite{ArchidiaconoCastorinaRedigoloSalvioni_UnveilingDarkFifthForcesLinearCosmology_2022}


\section*{Statement of Non-Originality}
These notes are far from being original.
It is just my personal rearrangement of the subject as I continue to learn it from a variety of people (much smarter than me).

\section*{Joining the project}
If you find these notes useful, if you find typos or if you would like to collaborate or suggest chages, do get in touch!
