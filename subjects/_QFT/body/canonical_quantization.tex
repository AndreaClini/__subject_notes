\section{Canonical Quantization in flat spacetime}
%=========================================================

A real scalar field $\phi(x)$ obeys the Klein-Gordon equation
\begin{equation}
    (\partial_{\mu} \partial^{\mu} + m^2) \phi(x) = 0.
\end{equation}
The canonical quantization procedure promotes the classical field $\phi(x)$ and its conjugate momentum $\pi(x) = \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \partial_0 \phi(x)}$ to operators $\hat{\phi}(x)$ and $\hat{\pi}(x)$ acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, satisfying the equal-time commutation relations
\begin{align}
    [\hat{\phi}(t, \mathbf{x}), \hat{\pi}(t, \mathbf{y})] &= i \delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}), \\
    [\hat{\phi}(t, \mathbf{x}), \hat{\phi}(t, \mathbf{y})] &= 0, \\
    [\hat{\pi}(t, \mathbf{x}), \hat{\pi}(t, \mathbf{y})] &= 0.
\end{align}

The Fourier transform of the fields are defined as
\begin{equation}
    \phi_k(t) :=\int d^3 x\, e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}} \phi(t, \mathbf{x}).
\end{equation}
The commutation relations in momentum space become
\begin{align}
    [\hat{\phi}_k(t), \hat{\pi}_{k'}(t)] &= i (2\pi)^3 \delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{k}'), \\
    [\hat{\phi}_k(t), \hat{\phi}_{k'}(t)] &= 0, \\
    [\hat{\pi}_k(t), \hat{\pi}_{k'}(t)] &= 0.
\end{align}
The harmonic oscillator are now decoupled in momentum space, but something seems to be off track.
Indeed
\begin{itemize}
    \item the field $\phi_k$ is no more self-adjoint, since $\phi_k^{\dagger} = \phi_{-k}$; whereas we would like our DoFs to be observables;
    \item the delta functions have argument $\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{k}'$ instead of $\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'$.
\end{itemize}
In fact, the two issues are essentially related.
We can fix them by explicitly rewriting $\phi_k$ as linear combinations of \emph{physical} self-adjoint harmonic oscillators.
Alternatively, we can directly pass to creation and annihilation operators.
