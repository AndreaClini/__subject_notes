# Subject Notes

These are my personal, self-written notes where I collect and arrange my understanding of various mathematics and physics subjects. They are not original research — many explanations are summaries or reorganizations of material from textbooks, lectures, and online sources. Expect typos, mistakes, informal explanations, and incomplete sections. These notes are forever a work in progress.

Use at your own risk. If you find mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
