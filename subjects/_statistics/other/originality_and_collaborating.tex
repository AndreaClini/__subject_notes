\section*{Abstract}
These are never-ending notes where I collect basic statistical ideas while learning them.
Hopefully they will grow into something useful (also for others).
We should cite something \cite{robert_casella_monte_carlo_2004}


\section*{Statement of Non-Originality}
These notes are far from being original.
They simply rearrange material from courses, books and conversations.

\section*{Joining the project}
If you find these notes useful, if you find typos or if you would like to collaborate or suggest changes, do get in touch!
