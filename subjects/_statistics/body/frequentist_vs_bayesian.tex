\chapter{Frequentist vs Bayesian perspectives}
%=========================================================
%=========================================================

A frequentist treats parameters as fixed and uncertainty as arising from hypothetical repetitions of the data.
Estimators are random variables, and properties such as unbiasedness or coverage are assessed over repeated samples.

A Bayesian treats parameters as random, encoding prior beliefs through a distribution and updating them via Bayes' rule,
\begin{equation}
    p(\theta \mid x) \propto p(x \mid \theta)\, p(\theta).
\end{equation}
The posterior combines prior information with the likelihood and turns point estimates into full distributions.

\section{A quick coin example}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider flips of a biased coin with heads count $k$ out of $n$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequentist: the maximum-likelihood estimate is $\hat{p}=k/n$ and a $95\%$ Wald interval is $\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}$.
    \item Bayesian: with a $\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)$ prior, the posterior is $\mathrm{Beta}(a+k, b+n-k)$, summarised by its mean or credible interval.
\end{itemize}
Both views often agree for large $n$, but diverge when data are scarce or priors encode substantial structure.
